# express-mongoDB-app
A Node.js Express app that displays data about the planets in our solar system. The data has been retrieved from a database stored with MongoDB.

The data is retrieved from MongoDB via a URI connection on the backend, and then assigned to a routing endpoint for the front end to 'fetch'.
